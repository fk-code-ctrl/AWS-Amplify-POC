# AWS-Amplify-POC
Setup to run lamda with grpahql using amplify framework. 
The lambda functions arent connected to any datasrouce but point to static file. 
Graphql schema is defined to query the todo objects. 

Clone and setup AWS profile and run amplify init to setup your project.

Once done do mock testing on the lambda. 

Hopefully this will help you get started with amplify and the overall framework.
